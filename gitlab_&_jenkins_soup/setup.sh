## NSO-DevOps-in-a-tin-can
## Author: @ponchotitlan
##
## This bash script initializes the containers required for a full CICD NSO demonstration
## Additionally, Python dependencies are installed, as mentioned in the requirements.txt file of this repository
## 
## The following containers are deployed (in order):
## - Gitlab-CE
## - Jenkins
## 
## The following directories are created:
## - ${HOME}/gitlab
## 
## IMPORTANT!
## Docker must have access permission to the ${HOME} directory of the host system
## The deployment of the containers aforementioned was tested on Mac M1, which means that it is ideal for ARM64 architectures
